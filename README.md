Analyze the dataset, merge the 3 datasets to get required results. Performed data visualizations. Encoded categorical variables. Trained the data to build 4 different models i.e., Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression, Support Vector Regression and Random Forest Regression. To compare the model, we used performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error and R-Squared Score. By observing this metrics, we conclude that Random Forest Regression is best model. And also performed hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV got a RMSE is 182 and improvement from the previous Random Forest Regressor model.
